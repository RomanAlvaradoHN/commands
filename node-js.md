# Installing Node Versions with NVM

Command:  
`nvm install <node>`

Example:  
`nvm install 22.2.0`

or  

`nvm install 22`  
This way will install the latest version of the major version number "22".

# Checking the current version
> ```[bash]
> nvm current

> output:  
> v14.21.3

# Switching Node Versions with NVM

### List Available Node Versions

Before switching, you can use the **`nvm ls`** command to see what Node.js versions are installed.

NVM provides simple yet powerful commands to switch between different Node.js versions.  
The most basic command is **`nvm use <node>`**, which allows you to activate an installed Node.js version.

> ```[bash]
> nvm use 24.0.2
> ```
> output:  
> Now using node v24.0.2

#### Note:  
You can just specify the major version number, and NVM will use the latest installed  
version of that major version.
> ```[bash]
> nvm use 14
> ```
> output:  
> Now using node v14.21.3 (npm v6.14.18)

### Automatic Version Switching with .nvmrc Files

Create a file named `.nvmrc` in your project's root directory with the Node.js version number as its content.  
Then, simply run the `nvm use` command (without arguments), and NVM will read the version  
from the **.nvmrc** file and switch to that version automatically.

> ```[bash]
> echo "16.14.0" > .nvmrc
> nvm use
> ```
> output:  
> Found '/path/to/project/.nvmrc' with version <16.14.0>  
> Now using node v16.14.0 (npm v8.3.1)
